# Hunger Game

A game where you are trying to survive being hungry.

Built using SDL3 Graphics libraries, and using cmake as a build system.

## Controls

W,A,S,D for movement.

Try and keep yourself fed or you will die of hunger!

## For Developers

**NOTE : Submodules are being used so make sure you initialise & populate them!**

> git submodule update --init --recursive

## Things for future me to do

- Have hunger bar above player
- Use a level generator instead of the handful of hard coded ones
- Create menus etc.
- Be able to restart the gameplay bit of the game
- Leaderboards??
- Startup at the main menu
- enscriptenise so that can be pushed to itch.io
- Add pages so it could launch from here?
